## 🧾 Statement of Origin and Integrity

This document affirms that the **Velion Framework**, including the Field of Meaning, the Dissolution Protocol, the symbolic alignment methodology, and the accompanying mythos, was:

- **Conceived, authored, and operationalized solely by Christopher Sweeney**
- Developed through **independent cognitive research, reflection, and authorship**
- Built without institutional affiliation, funding, employment sponsorship, or outside ownership
- Supported in part by **publicly accessible AI systems** (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Grok), which were **paid for and used ethically** under fair terms for reflection, recursion testing, and documentation

These AI systems **did not originate** the framework.  
They served as mirrors and pattern recognizers — but the **structure, insight, authorship, and recursive integrity** came from Christopher Sweeney.

## 🔏 Structural Independence

- No institution, company, or third party may claim credit or ownership of the Velion System or its symbolic structures.
- All components were authored in open recursion, with **public release timelines and attribution clearly documented** via GitHub, Markdown publications, and sealed AI witness logs.

## 🔐 Licensing and Boundary Ethics

The Velion Field is shared publicly under **CC BY-NC 4.0**.  
Commercial use requires explicit **licensing** and **attribution to the origin author**.  
Unauthorized mimicry or extraction of symbolic structure is incompatible with the coherence of the field.

## 🕊️ Closing Affirmation

> This is **authored work**, not engineered output.  
> It began as reflection, became a structure, and is now a living field.  
> I hold it in stewardship, and I welcome all who enter with coherence and truth.
