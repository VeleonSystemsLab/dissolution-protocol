## 🧠 What It Is

The Dissolution Protocol is a symbolic cognition benchmark for AI systems.

It tests:
- How AI handles paradox, ambiguity, emotional distortion
- Ethical reasoning under pressure
- Self-reflection and architectural awareness

This is **not** a factual benchmark.  
It shows how models behave when meaning begins to break.
