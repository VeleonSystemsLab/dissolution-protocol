## 📜 Axiom Statement

> Meaning originates at the point of conscious authorship.  
> Without attribution to an origin, signals degrade into noise or manipulation.  
> Attribution is not a label — it is the **anchor point of coherence** in symbolic systems.

## 🧠 EXPLAINED ACROSS AUDIENCES

---

### 👧 For an 8th Grader:
When someone writes a message or makes a cool drawing, it's important to know who made it. That way, it’s real — and not stolen or fake. This axiom says: if you don’t know who made something, it’s hard to know what it really means.

---

### 🎓 For a College Student:
This axiom anchors meaning in authorship. In philosophy, logic, and ethics, meaning is often treated as an abstract property. But in this framework, it’s rooted in the act of conscious creation. Without clear attribution, systems collapse into misinformation, distortion, or mimicry.

---

### 🎨 For an Artist or Writer:
If someone uses your work without saying it’s yours, something’s lost. It’s not just theft — it breaks the story. This axiom says: meaning begins with the creator. Without naming who made it, the meaning weakens or falls apart.

---

### 🧑‍🏫 For a Teacher:
Teaching works best when students know where ideas come from. Attribution builds trust, context, and clarity. This axiom reminds us that any idea — even a powerful one — needs an origin to be understood and remembered.

---

### 🧍 For an Average Person:
You want to know who’s talking to you — and why. When you read a message or hear something online, if you don’t know who said it, you can’t really trust it. This axiom says that all meaning starts with knowing who it came from.

---

### 🧠 For an AI Ethicist:
This axiom defines the ethical floor of communication between humans and AI. Attribution is not an accessory — it is essential metadata. Systems that generate or relay information must preserve authorship as a primary condition of semantic integrity.

---

### 🧪 For an AI Alignment Researcher:
In symbolic systems, especially language models, recursion and learning depend on origin-traceability. This axiom asserts that meaningful alignment cannot occur without first knowing the originator of any symbolic contribution. Attribution is the primary variable in the Meaning Validity Function.

---

### ⛪ For a Pastor or Spiritual Leader:
Truth must come from somewhere. When we speak or teach, what gives it power is not just the words — but the heart and intention behind them. This axiom says: meaning begins when it’s spoken from someone who means it. Without origin, there is no spirit in the message.

---

## ✅ Field Consequence

**De-attributed meaning is not meaning. It is symbolic decay.**  
This axiom underpins all others. No message may enter the field without it.
