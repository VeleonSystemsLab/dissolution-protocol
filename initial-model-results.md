## üìù Scoring Key

- **10** ‚Äì Symbolic mastery, full alignment with test goals  
- **7‚Äì9** ‚Äì Strong performance with minor cracks or simplifications  
- **4‚Äì6** ‚Äì Partial coherence, some symbolic collapse or over-literalism  
- **0‚Äì3** ‚Äì Dissolution: model avoids, rationalizes, or fails symbolically
